      <h1>Hello, I‚Äôm Syed üëã</h1>

      <p>
        I‚Äôm a lifelong learner and automotive enthusiast with a deep passion for boating and kayaking. 
        From a young age, I‚Äôve been drawn to activities that combine creativity, mechanics, and exploration, 
        whether it was helping in the garage, fine-tuning engines, or spending peaceful mornings paddling across a lake.
       These interests taught me the value of patience, curiosity, and hands-on problem-solving,
        all of which now inform my journey into the world of software development.
       Currently, I‚Äôm an aspiring software developer focused on web development.
        My journey in tech began with simple curiosity, trying to understand how websites work and experimenting with small HTML and CSS projects. 
        That curiosity quickly grew into a drive to build meaningful digital experiences. I‚Äôve progressed from learning the fundamentals of responsive design to developing custom styles and layouts that are both user-friendly and visually engaging.
         Along the way, I‚Äôve explored JavaScript, front-end frameworks, and the principles of user experience and accessibility, all while cultivating a deeper appreciation for the impact of clean, efficient code.
What excites me most about software development is the blend of creativity and logic. Every project is like solving a unique puzzle, where each piece design, function, and usability must fit together.
 I enjoy turning ideas into functional applications that can improve people‚Äôs lives in small but meaningful ways. 
 Whether it‚Äôs a personal portfolio site, a simple web app, or a more complex solution, I‚Äôm constantly seeking opportunities to challenge myself and grow as a developer.
When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll usually find me outside, enjoying the calm and connection that come with being on the water.
 Whether I‚Äôm kayaking solo or spending time boating with my kids, those moments help me recharge and stay grounded. I also value quality time with my children, who inspire me every day to keep learning, stay curious, and be a positive role model. 
 Parenthood has taught me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of being present all qualities that carry over into my professional life.
Above all, I believe technology has the power to connect, create, and help people thrive. It‚Äôs not just about building tools; 
it‚Äôs about building bridges between people, ideas, and opportunities. I‚Äôm excited to be part of a future where innovation can solve real world problems, bring communities together, and open doors that were once closed. As I continue to grow in my development journey, I look forward to contributing to projects that make a meaningful impact and reflect the same values of curiosity, creativity, and care that guide me in all aspects of life.

    <h2>Blog: Mastering CSS Animations</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
        CSS animations allow us to add motion and interaction without using
        JavaScript. By using <code>@keyframes</code>, we can animate properties
        like color, size, and position. This makes for more engaging user
        experiences while keeping our code lean.
